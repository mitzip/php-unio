#php-unio

`One REST API Spec for All.` - **for PHP**

This repo is a port of the `Unio` REST API client - it implements the **Facebook** APIs, and supports any REST API that can be described in JSON.

The initiative behind `unio` is to describe REST APIs in a simple, readable JSON file. This allows it to be trivially implemented by the `unio` client - making the implementation time for new REST APIs as close to **zero** as possible. See [the blog post](http://ttezel.github.com) motivating this client, and feel free to fork and add new REST API specs!

#Usage


	$unio = new Unio();
	$params = [
	    'q': 'coffee',
	    'access_token': 'YOUR_FB_ACCESS_TOKEN'
	];
	
	// with the facebook search API
	$unio
		->use('fb')
		->get('search', params, function (err, reply) {
			// first search result
	        	var_dump(reply[0]);
		});
	
	// add a new REST API spec to unio
	$unio
		->spec(apiSpec)
		->use('newly-added-spec')
		->post('some_resource', function (err, reply) {
		
		});

#API:

##`->use(service)`

Tells the `unio` client that the next HTTP request you make will be to `service`.

##`->spec(specObject)`
    
Adds a new REST API spec, described by `specObject`, to the `unio` client. Allows it the `use` it and make `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` requests to the REST API described by `specObject`.

See the [Facebook JSON spec](https://github.com/ttezel/unio/blob/master/specs/fb.json) and the [Twitter JSON spec](https://github.com/ttezel/unio/blob/master/specs/twitter.json) as examples. The specs that `unio` supports are in the `specs` folder.

##`->get(resource, [ params, callback ])`

**GET** a REST API `resource`, with optional params object (which will get url-encoded for you), and an optional `callback`, that has the following signature: `function (err, reply)`.

##`->post(resource, [ params, callback ])`

See `->get()` -> same thing but using **POST**.

##`->put(resource, [ params, callback ])`

See `->get()` -> same thing but using **PUT**.

##`->delete(resource, [ params, callback ])`

See `->get()` -> same thing but using **DELETE**.
